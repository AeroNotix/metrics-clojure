Changelog
=========

As of version ``1.0.0`` metrics-clojure is stable.  New features will still be
added, but backwards-incompatible changes should be very rare.

We use `semantic versioning <http://semver.org/>`_ to decide how to number
versions, so you know what's going to happen when you upgrade.


1.0.1
-----

Fixes compilation of ``defhistogram``, ``defcounter`` and friends.
