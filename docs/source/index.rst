metrics-clojure
===============

`metrics-clojure <http://metrics-clojure.rtfd.org/>`_ is a thin Clojure fa√ßade
around Coda Hale's wonderful `metrics <http://metrics.codahale.com/>`_ library.

**metrics-clojure is currently being built.  A lot of things work, but don't
complain if things change in backwards-incompatible ways.  Once it hits 1.0.0
it'll be stable, but until then use it at your own risk.**

metrics-clojure is a thin wrapper around metrics, so if you don't know what any
of the words in this documentaion mean you should probably read the `metrics
documentation <http://metrics.codahale.com/>`_ and/or watch the `talk
<http://pivotallabs.com/talks/139-metrics-metrics-everywhere>`_.
